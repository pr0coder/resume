			<h2>Bio</h2>
			<h3>Coding Excellence</h3>
			<img src="images/profile.jpg" width="337" height="337">
			<p>I discovered programming back in 2009, and self taught myself ActionScript 3.0 with the desire to build simple games. Immediately I developed a drive to learn new concepts and methods of programming. One year later I had the opportunity to get a job in Adobe Flash development creating simple games and activities. As my knowledge bagan to grow I decided to learn other languages such as C# and Java. Along the way I picked up skills in web development in my free time. Now I find myself studying Web and Software Development at Lakeshore Technical college; helping fellow students and creating projects that surpass expectations.</p>
			<p>Developing software is not just my career, it's my passion. My current skill level is never satisfactory, I always want to improve and learn new methods, and pull off tasks that seem too difficult.</p>
